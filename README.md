# Lighthouse Labs Final Project: "PizzaLab"

## Project Description
PizzaLab is a pizza ordering web app that allows hungry customers to order their pizza in two different ways, depending on their mood. A customer could decide to customize their pizza by choosing all the yummy ingredients. An adventurous customer could also let the app randomly generate a pizza for them. In both cases, the customer is able to preview the pizza before finalizing the order.
